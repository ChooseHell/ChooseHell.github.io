# War Catan

### **Offense**
Players may destroy other players’ constructions by buying and using weapons (cost defined below). Weapons may be purchased during a player’s turn by placing the cost face up on the table and declaring their intention. These cards are no longer counted as in the player’s hand. To use a weapon, a player must have played a number of knights over the course of the game equal to the number of weapons they are trying to use at once. An attacking player must be able to draw a path from one of their settlements/cities/forts to the target construction where the path only travels along roads of consenting players. Weapons are consumed once used. The number of weapons and knights required to destroy a construction is defined in this table:

|Construction | # of Weapons | # of Knights  |

| :---        |    :----:    |     :----:    |
| Road        | 1            | 1             |
| Settlement  | 2            | 2             |
| City        | 3            | 3             |
| Fort        | 3            | 3             |


### **Deffence**
Players may upgrade a settlement into a fort (cost defined below). The fort counts as 1 victory point and may not be destroyed by other players unless every road space leading into the fort’s space is occupied by roads of a differing color. Cities may be converted into forts for the same cost as upgrading a settlement to a fort. Forts may be converted into cities for the same cost of upgrading a settlement to a city.

### **Costs**

| Item        | Cost                    |
| :---        |    :----:               |
| Weapon      | 1 ore, 1 wood           |
| Fort        |1 sheep, 1 brick, 1 wheat|

### **Sharing Knights**
If a player needs more knights to destroy a construction, other players may allow them to use their knights, however knight sharing may only happen in these cases: 

1. between two players with connected roads. Two players have connected roads if a path exists from one settlement/city/fort owned by player 1 to one settlement/city/fort owned by player 2 where the path only travels along roads owned by consenting players and does not pass through constructions of non-consenting players. 

2. If both players have a path to the construction being attacked.

### **The Desert**
Each time a settlement is placed on the desert the placing player receives a face up (already played) knight card. Each time a settlement is upgraded into a city on the desert tile, the owning player receives a face up knight card.

### **Abandoned Roads**
Roads disconnected from any settlements/cities/forts of the same color become abandoned. They may no longer count towards longest road, may not be used to attack from, may not be built from, and always count as owned by a consenting player for connected roads purposes.

### **Burning Knights (Optional Rule)**
Players may burn night cards they have already played (discard, and play as if it had never been played), if they do so they gain a free weapon.

### **Pillaging (Optional Rule)**
When a player destroyes a settlement, they gain one researce chosen from among the resources the settlement could yield from. When a player destroyes a city, they gain two resources chosen from among the resources the city could yield from. When a player destroyes a fort, they gain three researces chosen from among the resources the fort could yield from.
