## Intro

Valor is a TTRPG that is designed for realism. Not the gritty, inventory hell kind of "realism" that was just conjured up in your head, rather Valor was designed to show off the Ancient and Medieval settings (and fantasy settings based on them) as the truly diverse and vibrant worlds they were. Valor is focused on presenting a historical take on the TTRPG because fundamentally our past is a diverse and vibrant world that deserves expiration.

The goal was to take lessons from groups like HEMA and mix it with classical and medievalist studies to create a system that does not rely on our modern interpretation and simplification of these times down to a few aesthetics. For this reason Valor focuses on servicing low to no magic settings (see section on settings). 

Valor is an attempt to recognize the fact that people of the pre-modern times were intuitive, creative and competitive and thus the world they inhabited would have been full of diversity in style, thought, and action. One does not need magic to make a setting or system deeply intriguing. Though it helps.

## Setting

Valor is designed to be mostly setting agnostic. There are rules for magic in the base rule set, but that section and its associated sections in character creation can be pulled out easily and a layered and balanced game can still be played. In the folder there are two sets of Alchemy and Weapon sheets. One is for a world based on a circa 300 AD mediterranean setting, what I am referring to as Classical. The other is for a world based on a circa 1450 AD northern european setting, what I am referring to as Medieval. 

## Mechanics

Valor works on a four attribute based system. Strength, Agility, Focus, and Confidence. A character’s attribute dice are a dice of magnitude equal to that attribute’s score. For example a Strength of 6 would mean that that character rolls d6s as her strength die. When she wants to do something she will roll a number of strength die equal to her skill in what she is doing (determined by titles). The number of these dice that come up greater than 3 is her success level.
